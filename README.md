# NodeJS Demo App - Task 1 (DevOps)

This is a simple Node.js demo application used for DevOps pipeline practice.

## What I did
- Created a simple Node.js app (index.js)
- Added a Dockerfile to containerize the app
- Wrote a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml) to:
  - Install dependencies
  - Run tests
  - Build Docker image
  - Push image to DockerHub

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
